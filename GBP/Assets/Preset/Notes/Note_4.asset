  text: Damn! That thing stabbed me! I had such a hard time getting to the reactor
    and it turned out that the terminal was blocked! Only the captain has access
    now. That bastard must've been the first one to get off the ship! Or died in
    some dark corner. Looks like it's a serious wound. I don't have much time. I'll
    try to hack into the terminal.
