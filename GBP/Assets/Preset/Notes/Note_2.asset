  text: 'Diary Entry #135 Project: GHA-47t Senior Scientist: Classified. Today I
    reviewed the reports, the test results are disappointing. The increase in the
    weight of the test sample was 220 percent of the initial weight. It seems that
    the protein in the serum has mutated into a parasitic form that took over the
    subject''s nervous system. The information collected over several days is enough
    to conclude that we have no way to remove this parasite. And one more thing,
    maybe it''s just me, but today I saw this thing trying to get out of its cell.'
