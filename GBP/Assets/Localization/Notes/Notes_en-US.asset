      should have gotten a job as an engineer at a regular company, on a regular
      project, not here! They paid a lot less, but this wouldn't have happened there.
      All right, I got to think about what to do next. From what the lab guys tell
      me, this thing feeds off the reactor's energy. And looking at the data coming
      directly from the reactor room, it's clear that it's doing it carefully, because
      the reactor itself hasn't shut down yet, and the ship's power hasn't been lost.
      Maybe if you crank up the power to 100% it will choke out. Of course it is
      dangerous to do this, but I do not see any other options.
