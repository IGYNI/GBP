      the reports, the test results are disappointing. The weight of the test sample
      has increased by 220% of the initial weight. It seems that the protein in the
      serum has mutated into a parasitic form. The information collected over the
      past few days is enough to conclude that we are not controlling the growth
      of the sample. And one more thing, maybe I''m imagining things, but today I
      saw this substance take root from the secure container."'

      same time spread through the ship like a virus."'

      do this, he needs my help. Why do I think this is a bad idea?"'

    m_Localized: I've had it up to here, I've had it! Why did I take this job? I
      should have gotten a job as an engineer at a regular company, on a regular
      project, not here! They paid a lot less, but this wouldn't have happened there.
      All right, I got to think about what to do next. From what the lab guys tell
      me, this thing feeds off the reactor's energy. And looking at the data coming
      directly from the reactor room, it's clear that it's doing it carefully, because
      the reactor itself hasn't shut down yet, and the ship's power hasn't been lost.
      Maybe if you crank up the power to 100% it will choke out. Of course it is
      dangerous to do this, but I do not see any other options.
