  text: I've had it up to here, I've had it! Why did I take this job? I should have
    gotten a job as an engineer at a regular company, on a regular project, not here!
    They would have paid much less, but this wouldn't have happened there. All right,
    I've got to think what to do next. From what the lab guys are telling me, this
    thing feeds off the reactor's energy. And looking at the data coming directly
    from the reactor room, it's clear that it's doing it carefully, because the reactor
    itself hasn't shut down yet, and the ship's power hasn't gone out. Maybe if cranking
    up the power to 100% it will choke out. Of course it is dangerous to do this,
    but I do not see any other options.
