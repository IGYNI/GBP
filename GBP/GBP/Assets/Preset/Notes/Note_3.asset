  text: 'Diary Entry #140 Project: GHA-47t Senior Scientist: Classified. The sample
    broke free and made its way into the reactor compartment. It sounds crazy, but
    it looks like it''s somehow feeding off his energy and spreading through the
    ship like a virus. We don''t have access to the bridge, so we can''t even call
    a rescue team. The captain has come up with a plan: to sneak into the hangar
    and to put on spacesuits to go out into space. There, holding on to the outer
    side of the cladding, we will be able to walk to the bridge. For this he needs
    my help. Why do I think this won''t work?'
